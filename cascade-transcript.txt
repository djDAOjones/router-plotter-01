SESSION COMPLETE - All objectives achieved!

[2025-10-16 22:30] Major interface redesign requested
[2025-10-16 22:30] REDESIGN SPECIFICATIONS:
  - Upload button moved to header (left aligned)
  - Image displayed prominently at top
  - Compact horizontal control rows below image
  - Playback controls: single play/pause toggle, reset, pause mode toggle, pause duration, 5-step speed slider (0.25x to 4x)
  - Design controls: clear, undo, new waypoint, color, thickness
  - Save/Load/Export row: save JSON, load, export WebM
  - Collapsible waypoint list with show/hide toggle
  - Path points vs waypoints distinction: clicks add path points, button creates waypoints
  - Minimal path smoothing (reduced curvature)
  - Initial modal to name first waypoint
  - Default animation speed: 5 seconds to traverse image width at 1x
  - Maintained responsive design

[2025-10-16 22:45] Complete redesign implemented:

HTML CHANGES:
- New header layout with left-aligned upload button
- Image container moved to top of page
- Four horizontal control rows (playback, design, save/export, waypoints)

- Added initial waypoint modal on app load
- Waypoint modal for creating named waypoints
- Collapsible waypoint list section

CSS CHANGES:

- Header with flex layout (left/center/right sections)
- Control groups for inline labels and inputs
- Speed slider with 5 discrete values
- Collapsible list styling with toggle button
- Path point vs waypoint visual distinction
- Updated responsive design for mobile

JAVASCRIPT CHANGES:
- Separated path points (all clicks) from waypoints (named major points)
- First point automatically becomes first waypoint with user-provided name
- New waypoint button creates waypoint at current last point
- Play/pause combined into single toggle button with visual state
- Pause at waypoints mode with configurable duration
- 5-step speed slider (0.25x, 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 4x)
- Speed calculation: 5 seconds to traverse full width at 1x
- Minimal smoothing: tension=0.1, segments=5 (vs 0.5, 20)
- Initial modal for first waypoint name
- Collapsible waypoint list with show/hide
- Updated save/load to include pathPoints and waypoints separately
- Removed CSV export
- Updated video export with calculated duration
- New undo logic to handle path points and waypoint indices

KEY IMPROVEMENTS:
âœ… Much cleaner, more compact interface
âœ… Image-first design philosophy
âœ… Distinction between path points and waypoints
âœ… Smoother workflow (click to add points, button for waypoints)
âœ… Better animation control with pause at waypoints
âœ… More intuitive speed control (discrete steps)
âœ… Proper speed calibration (5 seconds per width)
âœ… Minimal curvature for more realistic paths
âœ… Collapsible lists to reduce clutter
âœ… All functionality preserved and enhanced

FINAL STATUS: Complete redesign successfully implemented and ready for testing
