   - Speed multipliers scale proportionally
   - Consistent visual speed across all path segments

3. ENHANCED BEACONS:
   - Size doubled: 100 px/s expansion (was 50)
   - Duration doubled: 4 seconds (was 2)
   - Boldness tripled: line width 6 (was 2)

   - Duration calculated from actual path length

6. LINEAR INTERPOLATION (NO EASING):
   - Removed Catmull-Rom spline smoothing
   - Linear interpolation between path points
   - No easing on individual vectors
   - Constant speed between all points
   - More predictable movement

TECHNICAL CHANGES:

FINAL STATUS: All refinements implemented and ready for testing

[2025-10-17 08:02] Image embedding in save files:

FEATURE IMPLEMENTED:
- Save files now include base64-encoded image data
- Loading a saved route automatically restores the image
- No need to separately upload the image
- Backwards compatible with old save files (shows message if no image data)
- Image data stored alongside path points and settings

TECHNICAL CHANGES:
- Added imageData property to store base64 image
- Modified handleImageFile() to store image data
- Updated saveToJSON() to include imageData
- Enhanced handleImport() to load and render image from data

[2025-10-17 09:00] Local storage system implemented:

MAJOR FEATURE: LOCAL SAVE/LOAD SYSTEM
- Replaced download-based saves with browser-local storage
- Uses IndexedDB to store saves in browser
- "Saves" folder concept implemented in browser database
- All images and path data stored locally

NEW INTERFACE:
1. Save Locally button - prompts for save name, stores in browser
2. Manage Saves button - opens save manager modal
3. Export JSON button - downloads JSON file (for sharing)
4. Import JSON button - loads JSON file from disk
5. Export Video button - creates WebM animation

SAVE MANAGER FEATURES:
- Lists all saved routes with metadata
- Shows: name, date, waypoint count, point count, image name
- Load button - instantly loads route with image
- Delete button - removes save from browser
- Beautiful modal interface with scrolling list

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- IndexedDB database: 'RoutePlotterDB'
- Object store: 'saves' with auto-incrementing IDs
- Indexes on name and timestamp for sorting
- Complete route data stored: image, points, waypoints, settings
- Async operations with proper error handling

BENEFITS:
âœ… No file downloads cluttering disk
âœ… Instant save and load
âœ… Organized saves list
âœ… Full image embedding
âœ… Easy management (delete old saves)
âœ… Still can export/import for sharing
âœ… Persistent across browser sessions
âœ… Private to your browser

UI UPDATES:
- New Save Name modal for naming saves
- New Save Manager modal with list interface
- Updated button labels for clarity
- Separate export/import for JSON files

FINAL STATUS: Complete local storage system implemented and ready

[2025-10-17 09:14] Path smoothing toggle added:

NEW FEATURE: OPTIONAL PATH SMOOTHING
- New toggle button "Smoothing: On/Off" next to Beacons button
- Uses Catmull-Rom spline interpolation when enabled
- Very subtle smoothing (90% reduced, tension = 0.01)
- Creates gentle curves around corners
- Off by default (maintains straight lines)
- Enabled only when animation is possible (2+ points)

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Modified createSmoothPath() to support both modes:
  * Linear interpolation (smoothing off): straight lines between points
  * Catmull-Rom spline (smoothing on): gentle curves with minimal deviation
- Tension set to 0.01 (compared to typical 0.5) for 90% reduction
- Same 20 points per segment for smooth animation in both modes
- Smoothing state saved in settings (localStorage and JSON export)

USER EXPERIENCE:
- Toggle instantly updates route visualization
- Smoothing preserved in saves and exports
- Minimal visual difference ensures route accuracy
- Useful for more natural-looking paths without losing precision

FINAL STATUS: Path smoothing toggle implemented and ready for testing

[2025-10-17 10:51] Smoothing refinement and UI cleanup:

FIXES IMPLEMENTED:
1. SMOOTHING ONLY AT PLAYBACK:
   - Static route display now always shows straight lines
   - Smoothing only applied during animation playback
   - Authored path points remain unchanged
   - Toggle button works correctly (no redraw needed)

2. ALL SETTINGS SAVED AS ATTRIBUTES:
   âœ“ lineColor
   âœ“ lineThickness
   âœ“ currentSpeedIndex (speed)
   âœ“ pauseAtWaypoints
   âœ“ pauseDuration
   âœ“ showNamesAlways (name display)
   âœ“ showBeacons
   âœ“ useSmoothing
   - All saved in both local storage and JSON exports
   - All restored when loading saves

3. UI CLEANUP:
   - Hidden JSON Export button
   - Hidden JSON Import button
   - Hidden all Demo buttons
   - Cleaner interface focused on local saves

TECHNICAL CHANGES:
- Modified drawRoute() to always use straight lines (no smoothing)
- Removed redraw() call from toggleSmoothing()
- createSmoothPath() only called during animation
- Added CSS to hide unnecessary buttons

WORKFLOW:
- Author route with straight lines between points
- Toggle smoothing on/off affects only playback animation
- All visual and behavior settings preserved in saves

FINAL STATUS: Smoothing refinement and UI cleanup complete

[2025-10-17 11:23] Constant speed animation with waypoint easing:

MAJOR FIX: TRUE CONSTANT SPEED
- Replaced progress-based animation with distance-based animation
- Speed is now truly constant in pixels per second
- All path segments travel at the same visual speed
- No more "longer distances travel faster" issue

NEW ANIMATION SYSTEM:
1. Distance-based tracking:
   - currentDistance tracks pixels traveled
   - buildDistanceMap() creates cumulative distance array
   - getPositionAtDistance() finds exact position at any distance

2. Constant speed calculation:
   - 200 pixels/second base speed at 1x
   - Speed multipliers: 0.25x, 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 4x
   - Movement: distance += pixelsPerSecond Ã— deltaTime
   - Independent of path segment lengths

3. Waypoint easing:
   - Ease in: First 20% of journey from waypoint (quadratic)
   - Ease out: Last 20% of journey to waypoint (quadratic)
   - Constant speed in middle 60% of segments
   - Only applied between waypoint pairs
   - Smooth acceleration/deceleration

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- applyWaypointEasing() applies quadratic easing
- Easing calculated per segment based on waypoint positions
- Original path points used to determine waypoint segments
- 20 interpolation points per segment maintained

BENEFITS:
âœ… True constant visual speed
âœ… Smooth acceleration at waypoint starts
âœ… Smooth deceleration at waypoint arrivals
âœ… Natural-feeling motion
âœ… Speed independent of route complexity

FINAL STATUS: Constant speed animation with waypoint easing complete
